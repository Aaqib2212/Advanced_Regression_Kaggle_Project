# Advanced_Regression_Kaggle_Project
This project demonstrates a robust regression modeling pipeline to accurately predict housing prices using a structured dataset. The solution incorporates advanced data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the application of regularized regression techniques to enhance predictive performance.

# Project Highlights
1. **Comprehensive EDA**: Identified key drivers of house prices through correlation heatmaps, outlier detection, and distribution analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Addressed missing values, encoded categorical variables, and performed feature scaling and transformation.
3. **Model Implementation**:
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Employed RMSE and R² score for model assessment.
5. **Output Integration**: Generated prediction results suitable for downstream analysis or submission (e.g., Kaggle).
